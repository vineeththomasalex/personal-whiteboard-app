# Teams Personal Whiteboard Meeting Enhancement - Design Document

## 📋 Project Overview

This Teams app enhances meetings by providing each participant with a personal whiteboard for private notes/drawings, while giving presenters the ability to share selected participant whiteboards on the meeting stage. Built using Microsoft Live Share SDK with React.

**Key Features:**
- Personal whiteboard for each meeting participant (side panel)
- Presenter controls to share participant whiteboards on stage
- Session-only data (no persistence for privacy)
- Static snapshot sharing (no collaborative editing)

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

```
Teams Meeting Environment
├── Side Panel App (Always Available)
│   ├── Personal Canvas (Isolated per user)
│   ├── Drawing Tools (pen, highlighter, eraser)
│   ├── Share to Stage Button (for presenters)
│   └── User Identification
└── Meeting Stage App (Presenter Controlled)
    ├── Shared Canvas Display (Read-only snapshots)
    ├── Presenter Controls (show/hide, navigation)
    ├── Participant Selector
    └── Current User Indicator
```

### Live Share Data Model

```typescript
interface WhiteboardDataModel {
  // Stage visibility and control
  stageVisible: LiveState<boolean>;
  currentDisplayedUser: LiveState<string | null>;
  
  // Participant management
  participantCanvases: SharedMap<string, CanvasSnapshot>;
  activeParticipants: LivePresence<UserPresence>;
  
  // Individual canvases (isolated, not shared)
  personalCanvas: LiveCanvas; // Per user instance
}

interface CanvasSnapshot {
  userId: string;
  displayName: string;
  imageData: string; // Base64 encoded canvas content
  timestamp: number;
  isEmpty: boolean;
}

interface UserPresence {
  userId: string;
  displayName: string;
  role: 'presenter' | 'attendee';
  hasCanvas: boolean;
}
```

## 🎨 User Experience Design

### Participant Journey

1. **Meeting Join**
   - Side panel automatically appears with personal whiteboard
   - User can immediately start drawing private notes
   - Canvas is isolated - not visible to others

2. **Drawing Experience**
   - Simple toolbar: Pen, Highlighter, Eraser, Clear, Color picker
   - Responsive canvas that adapts to panel size
   - Visual feedback for active tool
   - Auto-save of canvas state

3. **Sharing Notification**
   - When presenter shares their canvas, subtle notification appears
   - Side panel remains available for continued private drawing
   - No interruption to personal workflow

### Presenter Journey

1. **Access Controls**
   - Additional "Share to Stage" button in side panel
   - Stage app opens when clicked
   - Presenter sees all participants with canvases

2. **Selection & Display**
   - Gallery view of participant thumbnails
   - Click to display selected canvas on stage
   - Navigation controls (previous/next)
   - Show/hide toggle for stage visibility

3. **Presentation Flow**
   - Large canvas display for all meeting attendees
   - Presenter name/context displayed
   - Easy cycling between participants
   - Quick hide when discussion moves on

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

```
App.tsx
├── Router (React Router)
│   ├── /sidepanel → SidePanelView
│   ├── /stage → StageView
│   └── /config → ConfigurationPage
├── LiveShareProvider (Context)
├── TeamsProvider (Teams SDK Context)
└── ErrorBoundary
```

### Core Components

**SidePanelView.tsx**
```typescript
interface SidePanelViewProps {
  // Uses LiveCanvas for personal drawing
  // Manages canvas tools and user interaction
  // Handles snapshot capture for sharing
  // Shows presenter controls if user has presenter role
}
```

**StageView.tsx**
```typescript
interface StageViewProps {
  // Displays selected participant canvas snapshots
  // Provides presenter navigation controls
  // Manages stage visibility state
  // Handles participant selection
}
```

**PersonalCanvas.tsx**
```typescript
interface PersonalCanvasProps {
  // Wraps LiveCanvas with drawing tools
  // Manages canvas state and user input
  // Provides save/clear functionality
  // Handles canvas resizing
}
```

**PresenterControls.tsx**
```typescript
interface PresenterControlsProps {
  // Show/hide stage toggle
  // Participant selection interface
  // Navigation controls (prev/next)
  // Canvas thumbnail preview
}
```

### Live Share Integration Strategy

**Isolated Personal Canvases:**
- Each user gets their own `LiveCanvas` instance
- Canvas data is NOT synchronized between users
- Only snapshot data is shared when presenter chooses

**Shared State Management:**
```typescript
// Stage control state
const [stageVisible, setStageVisible] = useLiveState("stageVisible", false);
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useLiveState("currentDisplayedUser", null);

// Participant snapshots
const [canvasSnapshots, setCanvasSnapshots] = useSharedMap("participantCanvases");

// Active participants
const [participants] = useLivePresence("whiteboardParticipants", initialPresence);
```

**Canvas Snapshot Process:**
1. User draws on personal canvas (isolated)
2. When presenter wants to share, capture canvas as image
3. Store snapshot in SharedMap with user ID
4. Display snapshot on stage (read-only)
5. Other participants see static image, not live canvas

## 🔐 Security & Privacy Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **Session-only storage**: No canvas data persists after meeting ends
- **Explicit sharing**: Canvases only shared when presenter actively chooses
- **No automatic capture**: Personal drawings never automatically visible
- **User consent**: Clear indication when canvas will be shared

### Teams Security Integration
- **SSO Authentication**: Uses Teams identity for user management
- **Role-based access**: Presenter controls only available to meeting presenters
- **Domain validation**: App only works within configured Teams domains
- **Live Share security**: All data flows through Microsoft's secure infrastructure

### Technical Security
- **Input validation**: All canvas operations validated
- **XSS protection**: Proper sanitization of user inputs
- **HTTPS only**: All communications encrypted
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse of sharing functionality

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Canvas Optimization
- **Efficient rendering**: Use canvas optimization techniques
- **Debounced saves**: Limit frequency of state updates
- **Image compression**: Optimize snapshot file sizes
- **Memory management**: Clean up canvas resources

### Live Share Efficiency
- **Minimal state sync**: Only share necessary data
- **Batched updates**: Group related state changes
- **Connection management**: Handle network interruptions gracefully
- **Presence optimization**: Efficient participant tracking

## 🔮 Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Phase 2 Features (Post-MVP)
- **Gallery view**: Show all participant whiteboards simultaneously
- **Selective sharing**: Participants choose which parts to share
- **Drawing templates**: Pre-made backgrounds and shapes
- **Export functionality**: Save snapshots as images
- **Meeting notes integration**: Connect with Teams meeting notes

### Advanced Features
- **Voice annotations**: Audio notes attached to drawings
- **Collaborative spaces**: Shared whiteboards for breakout discussions
- **Persistent notebooks**: Optional cross-meeting whiteboard storage
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with other meeting enhancement apps
