## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **React Architecture** ✅
```
App (TeamsProvider + ErrorBoundary)
├── TeamsProvider (Teams SDK initialization)
├── AppContent (Live Share Host creation) 
└── LiveShareProvider (Collaboration context)
    └── Router (Hash-based routing)
        ├── SidePanelView (Personal whiteboard)
        ├── StageView (Meeting stage)
        └── ConfigView (App configuration)
```

### **Key Technical Achievements** ✅
1. **Proper Initialization Timing**: Teams SDK initializes before Live Share Host creation
2. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive fallbacks and error handling
3. **Development Support**: Works outside Teams context with mock implementations
4. **Production Deployment**: Optimized build process with correct asset paths
5. **Teams Integration**: Full SDK integration with user context and meeting info

### **Live Production URLs** ✅
- **Side Panel**: `https://vineeththomasalex.github.io/personal-whiteboard-app/dist/sidepanel.html`
- **Stage View**: `https://vineeththomasalex.github.io/personal-whiteboard-app/dist/stage.html`
- **Configuration**: `https://vineeththomasalex.github.io/personal-whiteboard-app/dist/config.html`

## 🚧 Issues Successfully Resolved

### **1. Live Share Initialization Timing** ✅ **SOLVED**
- **Problem**: "The library has not yet been initialized" errors
- **Solution**: Wait for Teams SDK initialization before creating Live Share Host
- **Implementation**: Added proper async timing with 500ms safety delay

### **2. ILiveShareHost Interface Compliance** ✅ **SOLVED**  
- **Problem**: "getFluidTenantInfo is undefined" error in Teams
- **Solution**: Implemented complete ILiveShareHost interface in mock host
- **Implementation**: Added all required methods (getFluidTenantInfo, getFluidToken, etc.)

### **3. GitHub Pages Deployment** ✅ **SOLVED**
- **Problem**: Asset path issues with nested `/dist/` structure
- **Solution**: Configured Vite base path to `/personal-whiteboard-app/dist/`
- **Implementation**: Proper asset resolution for GitHub Pages hosting

### **4. Teams Context Handling** ✅ **SOLVED**
- **Problem**: Different behavior inside vs outside Teams
- **Solution**: Comprehensive environment detection and development fallbacks
- **Implementation**: Teams Provider with iframe detection and mock contexts
