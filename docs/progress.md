- **Configuration Flow**: Teams app setup with proper SDK integration
- **Teams Testing**: ✅ **Working in scheduled channel meetings**

### � **Meeting Type Support Status:**
- ✅ **Scheduled Channel Meetings**: Working perfectly
- ❌ **Private Meetings**: Not appearing in app list
- ❌ **Instant Meetings**: Not appearing in app list  
- ⚠️ **Note**: Manifest is correctly configured, likely environmental/policy limitations

### 🔄 **Current Migration to React:**
1. **HTML MVP Proven**: Core functionality validated in Teams
2. **React Setup**: Moving to React + TypeScript + Live Share
3. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Adding real participant data and sharing
4. **Production Ready**: Better architecture for scaling
